# It's me
Howdy, I'm Warwick. I chuck all my code here, so please excuse the mess.

Code used across all my repos:

![Languages I use](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=uozuAho)

Here's some of my projects I think are pretty neat:

- [Note searcher](https://github.com/uozuAho/note_searcher). A VS Code extension
  to manage my knowledge base of text files. Very similar to
  [Foam](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foam.foam-vscode),
  except a lot less popular :D
- [Pandemic DDD](https://github.com/uozuAho/pandemic_ddd). A C# implementation 
  of the [Pandemic board game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic_(board_game)),
  using some tactical Domain-Driven Design (DDD) concepts. Featured in a couple
  of my blog posts:
    - [Learning DDD by implementing pandemic](https://iamwoz.com/blog/20210924_learning_ddd_by_implementing_pandemic/)
    - [Making C# go fast](https://iamwoz.com/blog/20230330_making_csharp_go_fast/)
- [Cert demos](https://github.com/uozuAho/cert_demos). Learn how certificates
  work by following some practical examples.
- [What does the government do?](https://github.com/uozuAho/what-does-the-gov-do)
    - Code for the [website](https://what-does-the-government-do.netlify.app/)
      of the same name. A way to view the data on https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/
      at a party level, rather than individual MPs.

- [Pi cam, v2](https://github.com/uozuAho/pi_cam_v2)
    - Raspberry pi night vision camera. _Very_ MVP, but it did the job! See how
      I used it to catch mice in my house:
